 * This exception will be thrown if a Discord command shares one or more permissions along with the bot owner permission.
 * This is to prevent a security vulnerability when a command should only be accessible for the bot owner but let other roles access it.
 * The bot owner has full access to the bot already, so it isn't needed to add it to a command along with other permissions.
